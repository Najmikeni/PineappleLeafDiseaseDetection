# Pineapple Leaf Disease Detection via Image Processing 

This is my final year project 2023 created on Android Studio using the Java programming language and the detection model is created on Jupyter Notebook using the Python programming language.

This project presents an innovative approach aimed at enhancing early detection and management of pineapple leaf diseases by integrating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm and importing it using TensorFlow lite into an android mobile. The CNN model achieved an impressive total accuracy of 98% in precisely classifying three types of pineapple leaf diseases: Leaf Spot, Mealybug Wilt, and Pink Disease. 

When implemented in the mobile application, the system attained an overall confidence of 83.33% by leveraging both camera-captured and gallery images. The findings show that this technology has the potential to revolutionize disease detection in pineapple cultivation, enabling farmers and agriculture students to take timely and accurate responses for effective agricultural management. 

Although the accuracy gained is impressive, additional research and adjustments can be conducted to improve the system's performance and achieve even higher levels of accuracy. Through effective disease diagnosis and management, this work represents a significant step towards sustainable agricultural practices and increased crop yields.
